# Design-of-Spread-Spectrum-Correlator
The correlator is used to recover a signal that has been spread with a Gold Code using phase shift keying. The design runs at 333Mhz and can accept a base band sample every clock, and produces a correlation output. The block has 4 registers. A 10 bit Gold code is used. For more information on Gold Codes, refer to a web page https://natronics.github.io/blag/2014/gps-prn/. The output from the Gold Code is either a 1 or 0. The correlation is performed by adding the input sample when the Gold code is a 1, and subtracting when it is a zero. After processing all samples for the code length (1023 chips), the correlation value is output, The correlator sum cleared, and the process continues. The Gold code progresses at a ‘chipping’ rate. 
A DDS (Direct Digital Synthesis) system is used to provide a phase and frequency for determining when the Gold code should be advanced. This works by adding a 32 bit frequency value to a 32 bit accumulator. Whenever the accumulator is > 100,000,000, subtract 100,000,000 and advance the Gold code to the next chip. The accumulator is initialized to the phase when a sync signal is received.
A register is used to indicate which Gold code should be used to generate the chip values. The two PRN registers are initialized to all 1’s at sync time.
